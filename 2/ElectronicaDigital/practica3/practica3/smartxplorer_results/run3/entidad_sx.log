NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.

INFO:Par:282 - No user timing constraints were detected or you have set the option to ignore timing constraints ("par
   -x"). Place and Route will run in "Performance Evaluation Mode" to automatically improve the performance of all
   internal clocks in this design. Because there are not defined timing requirements, a timing score will not be
   reported in the PAR report in this mode. The PAR timing summary will list the performance achieved for each clock.
   Note: For the fastest runtime, set the effort level to "std".  For best performance, set the effort level to "high".

   option. All paths that are not constrained will be reported in the
   unconstrained paths section(s) of the report.
INFO:Timing:3339 - The clock-to-out numbers in this timing report are based on a
   50 Ohm transmission line loading model.  For the details of this model, and
   for more information on accounting for different loading conditions, please
   see the device datasheet.
INFO:Timing:3390 - This architecture does not support a default System Jitter
   value, please add SYSTEM_JITTER constraint to the UCF to modify the Clock
   Uncertainty calculation.
INFO:Timing:3389 - This architecture does not support 'Discrete Jitter' and
   'Phase Error' calculations, these terms will be zero in the Clock Uncertainty
   calculation.  Please make appropriate modification to SYSTEM_JITTER to
   account for the unsupported Discrete Jitter and Phase Error.
