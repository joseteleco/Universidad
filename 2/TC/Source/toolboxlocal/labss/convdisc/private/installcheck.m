function installcheck()
%INSTALLCHECK Check the current installation.
%   A common error when unpacking the archive of program
%   files is to dump all the files into a single directory
%   instead of unpacking it with the proper directory 
%   hierarchy.  This function provides a simple check
%   to see if this occurred.
%
%   NOTE: To work this function MUST be placed in a directory
%   called private and called from the parent directory.
%
%   This function simply checks to see if it is contained
%   in a directory called private.  If so, it is more than
%   likely that the archive was unpacked correctly and no 
%   error is generated.  If it is not inside a private directory
%   then an error is generated which suggests to the user
%   a possible cause for the installation error.
