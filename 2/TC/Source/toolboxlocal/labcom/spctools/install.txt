Obtaining the SPC Toolbox

The SPC Toolbox is distributed in TAR format for UNIX platforms and 
by ZIP file for PC's.
UNIX install:

1) Create a subdirectory in the "../matlab/toolbox" directory 
called "spctools".  You can create a subdirectory in your "home" 
or other directory but you will have to edit the files 
"spcpath.m" and "spcdata.m" to set the 'matdir' to point to the 
"spctools" directory.
2) Copy the "spctools.tar" file to this directory.
3) Extract the tar file with the command "tar xvf spctools.tar".
----
NOTE: If you are installing spctools.sh downloaded from the ftp 
site at ftp.mathworks.com, use the following
1) ignore.
2) Copy the spctools.sh file to the "../matlab/toolbox" 
directory.
3) Extract the sh file with the command "sh spctools.sh".  
Extracting the sh file will create the "spctools" subdirectory.
----
4) Modify the MATLAB resource file to append the "spctools" and 
all the subdirectories contained in it to the MATLABPATH.  
Optionally, a link can be made from a directory already contained 
in the MATLABPATH to point to the file "spcpath.m" in the 
spctools directory.  In this configuration, users must first 
execute the SPCPATH program to gain full access to the SPC 
Toolbox.
5. Execute the "spcsetup" to set the proper file permissions and 
the "spcmex" script to create the mex-files (not required but it 
will speed up execution of some functions).  Mex files for MS-
Windows are distributed in "spctools.zip".  Mex files for other 
platforms will have to be created using you're own tools (I 
currently have access to a PC only).
Files
-----
After extracting the SPC Toolbox, the spctools directory will 
contain a number of C-shell scripts, m-files and data files, and 
a number of subdirectories.  The SPC Toolbox commands are grouped 
into the subdirectories according to function.
C-Shell scripts:
----------------
spcsetup - Script to set the file permissions on all the SPC 
Toolbox files.  This should be executed once to ensure proper 
file permissions are set.
spcmex - Script to compile mex files on UNIX machines.  The 
toolbox is distributed with Sun4 mex files.  If you are running 
on an machine other than a sun4, you will have to execute this 
script.

spctar - Script to create a tar file containing the SPC Toolbox.
spc2sun - Script to copy the SPC Toolbox from an MS-DOS formatted 
floppy disk containing the SPC Toolbox from a directory called 
"spctools".  The script uses the mtools commands for DOS copying. 
The SPC toolbox is installed into the current directory on the 
Sun workstation.
spc2flop - Script to copy the SPC Toolbox from a Sun to a MS-DOS 
formatted floppy disk.  The script places all the necessary files 
a directory structure beginning with the directory "spctools" on 
the floppy disk.  The MS-DOS mex files are copied to the floppy 
so that it may then be used to install the SPC Toolbox on a PC.  
This file will have to be edited to ensure the SPCDIR variable 
points to the spctools directory.  The script should be edited to 
ensure the proper disk drive if pointed to the the "drive" 
variable.  The SPC Toolbox requires a high density (1.4 MByte) 
floppy.  The user is asked if they want to format the floppy 
before the files are copied.
M-files:
--------
spcpath - Program to append the SPC toolbox directories to the 
users MATLABPATH.  This script is used when the SPC Toolbox is 
installed such that to access it, the user must first execute 
this program.  If the SPC Toolbox has not been setup in the 
toolbox directory (or the MATLAB environment variable does not 
set or not set to point to the "../matlab" directory), this file 
will have to be edited so that the "matdir" variable points the 
the "../matlab" directory.
spcdata - Loads the data used in the SPC Toolbox documentation 
into the MATLAB workspace.  If the SPC Toolbox has not been setup 
in the toolbox directory (or the MATLAB environment variable does 
is not set or not set to point to the "../matlab" directory), 
this file will have to be edited so that the "matdir" variable 
points the the "../matlab" directory.
spconfig - Copies "spcolors.m", "spcbandw.m" and "spcolor.m" 
configuration files to the users home directory.  The user can 
then edit the spcolor.m or spcbandw.m files to suit their 
preference and then copy them over the spcolors.m file.  For this 
file to override the one in the SPC Toolbox directory, it must be 
reachable first in the MATLABPATH.  If the SPC Toolbox has not 
been setup in the toolbox directory (or the MATLAB environment 
variable does is not set or not set to point to the "../matlab" 
directory), this file will have to be edited so that the "matdir" 
variable points the the "../matlab" directory.
spc2flop - Program a user can use to copy the SPC Toolbox to an 
MS-DOS formatted floppy disk.  The program simply executes the 
spc2flop C-shell script.
Use of undocumented functions

-----------------------------
The SPC Toolbox has made use of one undocumented function, one 
undocumented m-file, and one undocumented uicontrol property.  In 
the case of the uicontrol "Enable" property, the Mathworks made 
extensive use of it in their MATLAB Expo demonstration.  Thus, 
any version that ships with the MATLAB Expo should not have a 
problem running the SPC Toolbox.
The undocumented built-in function "gs_modal_warn" provides a 
modal

dialog box for reporting errors to the user and requires their 
acknowledgement before any continuation with MATLAB operation.  
The undocumented m-file provides the same functionality but is 
not modal. Because these two functions are not included in every 
version of MATLAB, some problems may occur.  To avoid this, the 
only use of these functions are in the m-file SPCWARN.M in the 
spctools/progtool directory.  You should edit this file if your 
version of MATLAB does not support either of these functions.  
This file check the computer it is running on and determines if 
it is OK to run either function.  YOU have to tell the function 
it is OK.  Simply edit this file to include your computer in the 
comparison operation if the following command will create a 
dialog box on your screen.

	>> gs_modal_dialog('Test','OK')

The file SPCWARN.M has been shipped with the gs_modal_dialog 
command enabled for PCWIN and SUN4 computers.
SPC Toolbox for MS-Windows MATLAB

---------------------------------
The SPC Toolbox is now available for downloading to a floppy disk 
which can then be used to install the SPC Toolbox on a PC running 
MATLAB for Windows.  To download a copy:

1. Log into a Sun with a floppy drive on the ECE network.
2. Start MATLAB 4.1 (matlab).
3. Execute "spcpath" from the MATLAB prompt to access the SPC 
Toolbox.
4. Place a 1.4M high density floppy disk into the disk drive.
5. Execute "spc2flop" from the MATLAB prompt.  You'll be asked if 
you want to format the floppy.  After formatting, the SPC Toolbox 
files will be copied to a directory called "spctools" on the 
floppy.  After completion, the disk will automatically be ejected 
from the drive.  The toolbox will use the full 1.4M floppy.
6. To load SPC Tools onto a PC, from the MS-DOS prompt change to 
the "\matlab\toolbox" directory.
7. Place the floppy into a drive and execute
xcopy a:\spctools spctools /s


from the MS-DOS prompt.  If you have not loaded SPC previously 
(e.g. the \matlab\toolbox\spctools directory does not already 
exist), you'll be asked if "spctools" is a directory or a 
filename.  Respond that it is a directory.  After a lot of disk 
activity, SPC Tools will be loaded onto your hard drive.
8. To complete installation, add the following directories to the 
"\matlab\matlabrc.m" file where the matlabpath variable is set.
....
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools;',... 
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spcgui;',... 
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spcline;',... 
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spcprog;',... 
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spcspch;',...

'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spccomms;',... 
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spcutil;',... 
'e:\matlab\toolbox\spctools\spcsspi;',... ...
